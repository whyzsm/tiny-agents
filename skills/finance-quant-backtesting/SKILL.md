# 量化回测

Use this skill as the routing entry point for the 量化回测 workflow. It coordinates the companion skills in this bundle instead of replacing them.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/guide.md` to classify the user request, required inputs, and expected deliverables.
2. Choose the smallest relevant companion skill set. For full-package requests, run the guide steps in order.
3. Preserve user-provided facts and mark assumptions explicitly. Ask only for missing inputs that block the next useful step.
4. For healthcare or finance work, present outputs as informational analysis unless the user supplies licensed-professional context; clearly flag urgent/high-risk findings and recommend qualified professional review when appropriate.
5. Return concrete artifacts named by the guide, plus open questions, risks, and verification notes where relevant.

## Companion Skills

- `$joinquant`
- `$stock-strategy-backtester`
- `$quant-backtest-strategy`
- `$quant-strategy`
- `$quant`
- `$openclaw-backtester`

## Output

Produce only the deliverables relevant to the matched workflow. For full-package requests, assemble the final output package described in `references/guide.md`.
